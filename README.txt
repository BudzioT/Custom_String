Hi, this is my version of the class #std::string (std::basic_string<char>)# and the first ever project that I created.
It probably has some errors in some places, but I'm pretty happy in terms of how it turned out. 

It is pretty usable in most, not advanced cases.
You can see, that I've been working on this project for some time (Some functions are worse than others, 
some comments, that I've first written are pretty bad).
