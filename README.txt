Hi, this is my version of the class std::string. It probably has some errors sometimes,
but I'm pretty happy in terms of how it turned out (This is my first project). 
It is pretty usable in most not advanced cases.
You can see, that I've been working on this project for some time (Some functions are worse than others, 
some comments, that I've first written are pretty bad).
