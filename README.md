## :page_with_curl: Overview
- This is my own implementation of the class std::string (std::basic_string<char>).
- It has most of the methods, functions that are available in the normal std::string. 

## :heavy_exclamation_mark: Warning
- This was my first project, made in the summer of 2023.<br>
  Because of that, it can have some mistakes when combining several methods at once.

## :computer: Compiling
- Just include String.h into your project.
- Compile with String.cpp for it to work.
